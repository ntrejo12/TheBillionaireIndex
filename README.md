<H2> Top-K Billionaire Sorter</h2>
This project implements and compares two classic sorting algorithms 
— <b>Heap Sort</b> and <b>Merge Sort</b> — to identify the <i>top-k 
wealthiest individuals</i> from Forbes’ annual <i>World’s Billionaires</i> 
rankings dataset (2002–2023). The project evaluates the efficiency of 
these algorithms in large-scale, real-world financial data.


<H2> Problem Statement </H2>

In financial analysis, economics, and media rankings, determining the
top-k wealthiest individuals in a given year is a common yet 
computationally challenging task. Sorting the entire dataset to extract
only a small subset of key results becomes inefficient as dataset sizes
grow. Our project addresses this by implementing and comparing sorting 
algorithms optimized for top-k selection.

<H2> Features Implemented </H2>

<ul>
  <li>Users can input a specific year and k-value to dynamically retrieve the top-k richest individuals for that year.</li>
  <li>Both Heap Sort and Merge Sort are implemented.</li>
  <li>Execution time for each algorithm is displayed for comparison purposes.</li>
  <li>Output is consistent across both sorting approaches.</li>
</ul>
