<H1> COP3530 - Project 3 TheBillionaireIndex</h1>

<H2> Top-K Billionaire Sorter</h2>
This project implements and compares two classic sorting algorithms — <b>Heap Sort</b> and <b>Merge Sort</b> — to identify the <i>top-k wealthiest individuals</i> from Forbes’ annual <i>World’s Billionaires</i> rankings dataset (2002–2023). The project evaluates the efficiency of these algorithms in large-scale, real-world financial data.


<H2> Problem Statement </H2>

In financial and media analysis, quickly identifying the top-k wealthiest individuals from a large dataset is a frequent task. Sorting the entire dataset for just a subset of results introduces unnecessary computational overhead. Our project addresses this issue by implementing efficient sorting solutions tailored to the top-k use case.

<H2> Features Implemented </H2>

<ul>
  <li>Users can input a specific year and k-value to dynamically retrieve the top-k richest individuals for that year.</li>
  <li>Both Heap Sort and Merge Sort are implemented.</li>
  <li>Execution time for each algorithm is displayed for comparison purposes.</li>
  <li>Output is consistent across both sorting approaches.</li>
</ul>
